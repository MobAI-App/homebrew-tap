# Formula for simslim: slim iOS simulators to run many more on one Mac.
#
# Installs a prebuilt Homebrew bottle so `brew install` never runs a source
# build (which triggers Xcode/Command-Line-Tools version checks). After each
# release, update the source `sha256` and the bottle stanza from the values the
# GitHub Actions release workflow prints.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      simslim drives iOS simulators, so it needs Xcode with an iOS Simulator
      runtime installed (not just the standalone Command Line Tools).

      Verify the CLI runs:
        simslim list
    EOS
  end

  test do
    assert_match version.to_s, shell_output("#{bin}/simslim --version")
  end
end
